The formula for the nth centered hexagonal number is `(n * (2 * n - 1))`. The first centered hexagonal number is 1, so the function returns 1 for `n=1`. The function works by multiplying `n` by `2n - 1`, which gives the number of sides of a regular hexagon with `n` rows. The number of sides is equal to `2n - 1` because there are `n` rows and `n` rows have `n` sides each. The first centered hexagonal number is 1, so the function returns 1 for `n=1`. The function works for all positive integers `n`.\r\n\r\nTo test the function, we can call `centered_hexagonal_number(10)` and it should return 271, which is the 10th centered hexagonal number. "}

We start by converting n to a string and splitting it into a list of digits using the `list()` function.\r\n2. We then initialize a variable called `closest` to None, which will be used to keep track of the closest smaller number.\r\n3. We loop through the digits in reverse order using a `for` loop and the `range()` function. We start at the last index and go backwards to the first index.\r\n4. If the current digit is less than the next digit, we update the current digit to be one less than its value and convert the digits list back to an integer using the `join()` method.\r\n5. We return the closest number as an integer.\r\n6. If no smaller number is found, we return None.\r\n\r\nHere's how we can test the function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(closest_num(11)) # Output: 10\r\nprint(closest_num(23)) # Output: 22\r\nprint(closest_num(123)) # Output: 122\r\nprint(closest_num(1234)) # Output: 1223\r\nprint(closest_num(12345)) # Output: 1233\r\nprint(closest_num(123456)) # Output: 12344\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the function only works for positive integers.

Then, it uses the `newman_williams` function to find the nth Newman-Williams prime number. The `newman_williams` function checks if a number is a Newman-Williams prime by testing if it is divisible by any prime number up to its square root. If it is, it checks if it is also divisible by the next prime number raised to a power greater than 1. If both conditions are met, it is not a Newman-Williams prime. If not, it is a Newman-Williams prime and the count is incremented. The function continues to increment the number until the nth Newman-Williams prime is found. The limit used in the sieve function can be adjusted to find larger or smaller Newman-Williams primes. "}

The count is then added to the dictionary with the element as the key and the count as the value.\r\n\r\nFinally, the function returns the `count_dict` dictionary.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> count_Occurrence(['a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'], ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'))\r\n{'a': 2, 'c': 1, 'b': 2, 'd': 2}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that the element 'a' occurs twice in the tuple, 'c' occurs once, 'b' occurs twice, and 'd' occurs twice.

We also initialize `result` to the first element of the array. We then iterate through the array starting from the second element. If the current element is positive, we update `max_product` and `min_product` accordingly. If the current element is negative, we swap their values. We update `result` with the maximum of `max_product` and `result`. Finally, we return `result`.\r\n\r\nThe reason for swapping `max_product` and `min_product` when the current element is negative is that if the current element is negative, we want to ensure that the product is positive. For example, if the current element is -2 and the previous element is 7, we want to ensure that `max_product` is 7 and `min_product` is -2, so that the product is positive. If the current element is negative and the previous element is negative, we want to ensure that `max_product` is the smaller negative number and `min_product` is the larger negative number. This is because the product of two negative numbers is positive, and we want to maximize the product. "}

It uses the `cmath` module to calculate the `x` and `y` coordinates of the point in rectangular coordinates. The `cmath.cos()` and `cmath.sin()` functions are used to calculate the sine and cosine of the angle, respectively. The `cmath` module is used instead of the built-in `math` module because it handles complex numbers, which are needed to represent the imaginary component of the output.\r\n\r\nThe function returns a tuple containing the `x` and `y` coordinates as complex numbers. The `cmath.cos()` and `cmath.sin()` functions return complex numbers, but we only need the real part of the result, which is the `x` coordinate. The imaginary part of the result is 0, so we can ignore it. The `cmath.cos()` function returns a complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of `cos(theta)`, which we can extract using the `real` attribute. The `cmath.sin()` function returns a complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of `sin(theta)`, which we can extract using the `imag` attribute. We multiply the radius by the sine and cosine of the angle to get the `x` and `y` coordinates, respectively.

For example, C(5, 3) = 10 because there are 10 ways to choose 3 items from 5 items (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). We can use this formula to find the product of consecutive binomial coefficients:\r\n\r\nC(n, i) * C(n, i+1) * C(n, i+2) = n! / (i! * (n-i)! * (i+1)!) * (n-i-1)! * (n-i-2)!\r\n\r\nThe sum of these products is equal to n! * (n-1)!/i! * (n-2)! * (n-3)! + n! * (n-1)!/i! * (n-2)! * (n-3)! + ... + n! * (n-i)! * (n-i-1)! * i!\r\n\r\nWe can use this formula to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial coefficients by iterating over the range from 0 to n-2 and adding up the product of the binomial coefficients for each i.\r\n\r\nFor example, for n=3, we have:\r\n\r\nC(3, 0) * C(3, 1) * C(3, 2) = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6\r\nC(3, 1) * C(3, 2) * C(3, 3) = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6\r\nC(3, 2) * C(3, 3) * C(3, 4) = 1 * 1 * 1 = 1\r\n\r\nSo the sum is 6 + 6 + 1 = 13.\r\n\r\nWe can generalize this formula to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial coefficients for any n:\r\n\r\nsum = 0\r\nfor i in range(n-2):\r\n    sum += n * (n-i) // (i+1) * (n-i-1) // (i+2) * (n-i-2) // (i+3)\r\n\r\nreturn sum\r\n\r\nThe // operator is used to perform integer division, which gives the quotient of the division operation.

We create a list `dp` of size `n` where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest subset that ends at index `i`. We initialize all the values of `dp` to 1 since every number is a subset of itself. Then, we iterate over the list and for each pair of indices `i` and `j`, we check if `lst[i]` is divisible by `lst[j]` or vice versa. If it is, we update `dp[j]` to be the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j]` plus 1. This means that we can include `lst[j]` in the subset that ends at `i`. Finally, we return the maximum value in `dp` which represents the size of the largest subset that satisfies the condition.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nlst = [1, 3, 6, 13, 18]\r\ndp = [1, 1, 1, 1]\r\n\r\n# dp[0] = 1, dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = 1, dp[3] = 1\r\n\r\n# dp[0] = 1, dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = 1, dp[3] = 1\r\n# lst[0] % lst[1] = 1, lst[1] % lst[0] = 1, lst[2] % lst[1] = 1, lst[1] % lst[2] = 1, lst[3] % lst[1] = 1, lst[1] % lst[3] = 1\r\n# dp[0] = 1, dp[1] = 2, dp[2] = 2, dp[3] = 2\r\n\r\n# dp[0] = 1, dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = 1, dp[3] = 2\r\n# lst[0] % lst[2] = 1, lst[2] % lst[0] = 1, lst[3] % lst[2] = 1, lst[2] % lst[3] = 1, lst[3] % lst[0] = 1\r\n# dp[0] = 1, dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = 2, dp[3] = 3\r\n\r\n# dp[0] = 1, dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = 2, dp[3] = 3\r\n# lst[0] % lst[3] = 1, lst[3] % lst[0] = 1\r\n# dp[0] = 1, dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = 2, dp[3] = 3\r\n\r\n# dp[0] = 1, dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = 2, dp[3] = 3\r\n# lst[1] % lst[3] = 1, lst[3] % lst[1] = 1\r\n# dp[0] = 1, dp[1] = 2, dp[2] = 2, dp[3] = 3\r\n\r\n# dp[0] = 1, dp[1] = 2, dp[2] = 2, dp[3] = 3\r\n# lst[2] % lst[3] = 1, lst[3] % lst[2] = 1\r\n# dp[0] = 1, dp[1] = 2, dp[2] = 3, dp[3] = 3\r\n\r\n# dp[0] = 1, dp[1] = 2, dp[2] = 3, dp[3] = 3\r\n\r\n# return max(dp) = 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nTherefore, the size of the largest subset of the list [1, 3, 6, 13, 18] is 3.

We create a 2D array `dp` of size `n x n` to store the maximum cost of the path ending at each cell. We initialize the top-left cell with the cost of the cell itself. Then, we fill the first row and first column of the `dp` array. For each cell `(i, j)`, we calculate the maximum cost of the path ending at that cell by taking the maximum of the cost of the path ending at the cell above it and the cost of the path ending at the cell to the left of it. Finally, we fill the rest of the `dp` array using the same logic. The maximum cost of the path ending at the bottom-right cell is stored in `dp[n-1][n-1]`. To get the average cost, we divide this value by the number of cells visited, which is `n-1` since we don't count the bottom-right cell.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmatrix = [[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4], [7, 3, 9]]\r\nn = len(matrix)\r\ndp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\r\ndp[0][0] = matrix[0][0]\r\nfor i in range(1, n):\r\n    dp[0][i] = dp[0][i-1] + matrix[0][i]\r\n    dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + matrix[i][0]\r\nfor i in range(1, n):\r\n    for j in range(1, n):\r\n        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + matrix[i][j]\r\nprint(dp)\r\n# Output: [[1, 8, 11], [13, 13, 11], [16, 13, 12]]\r\nprint(dp[n-1][n-1] / (n-1))\r\n# Output: 5.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above example, the maximum cost of the path ending at the bottom-right cell is 12, which is the maximum of the cost of the path ending at the cell to the left of it and the cost of the path ending at the cell above it. The average cost is 12 / 2 = 6. "}

It initializes two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the beginning and end of the list respectively. It then enters a loop that continues until `left` is greater than `right`. In each iteration, it calculates the midpoint of the list and checks if the value at the midpoint is less than `val`. If it is, it moves the `left` pointer to the right of the midpoint. If it's not, it moves the `right` pointer to the left of the midpoint. This process continues until `left` is greater than `right`. At this point, `left` will be the index where `val` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.\r\n\r\nFor example, if `arr` is `[1,2,4,5]` and `val` is `6`, the function will first calculate the midpoint `mid = 2`. Since `arr[2]` is less than `val`, it moves the `left` pointer to `3`. The next iteration will calculate `mid = 1`, and since `arr[1]` is still less than `val`, it moves the `left` pointer to `2`. The loop will terminate with `left = 2`, and the function returns `2`, which is the index where `val` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. "}

It uses a for loop to iterate through each item in the input tuple. If the item is a tuple, it recursively calls the `remove_nested` function on that tuple and extends the result to the `result` list. If the item is not a tuple, it appends it to the `result` list. Finally, it returns the `result` list as a tuple.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> remove_nested((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10))\r\n(1, 5, 7, 4, 6, 10)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function works by flattening the input tuple by removing all nested tuples and returning a new tuple with the remaining elements.
